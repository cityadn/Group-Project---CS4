            <h3>Start your day with a plan</h3>
            <p>It all starts with a plan. It is highly recommended to create a task list for what you want to accomplish that day. Once you have completed a task, you can physically cross it off which mentally helps give you a sense of accomplishment that you have completed your work. </p>

            <i class="fa-solid fa-envelope"></i>
        <h3>Leave emails for later</h3>
        <p>Every time you stop to check your emails, this is actually derailing your productivity and diverts your attention away from the main task. Instead, set a specific time to check your emails or first finish your current job. This will ensure that you are still communicating with colleagues whilst also completing the tasks that have been set.</p>

    <h3>Use Calendars</h3>
    <p>Having all of your meetings, events, deadlines and so on, in one place on a calendar will save you a lot of time and make your life easier. We would recommend Google Calendar to help you make efficient use of your time - this is also very convenient as it can be viewed on multiple devices.</p>

    <h3>Know when to say No</h3>
    <p>Events such as meeting are not always the best use of time, therefore it can be wise to say no. First, express that you have a busy schedule and prioritise the tasks you have set and ask if meetings can be replaced with email. This ensures that you are able to make time for meetings still whilst also not letting it impact your workload. </p>

    <h3>Take time to recharge</h3>
    <p>Like every human being, there are times you need to put down the pen and work, recharge your batteries and call it a day. When you're exhausted, not only will you not perform well but you will also waste a lot of time. It is important that your body gets the scientific recommended rest whilst also ensuring you keep yourself entertained and still doing the things you enjoy.</p>

    <h3>Divide larger tasks into smaller tasks</h3>
    <p>It all starts with a plan. It is highly recommended to create a task list for what you want to accomplish that day. Once you have completed a task, you can physically cross it off which mentally helps give you a sense of accomplishment that you have completed your work. </p>

    <h3>Limit Distractions</h3>
    <p>Distraction is a normal feeling that ranges from social media, children, people, procastination and many things that can cause you to deviate away from task. To avoid this, we would recommend that you identify things distract you. Do you need your mobile phone? Should you block social media? Should you turn notifications off for texts or emails? </p>

    <h3>Prioritise the most important tasks</h3>
    <p>With a complete to-do list, begin to sort out the tasks in order of priority. This will help you to focus on the most important tasks of the day you'd like to accomplish and tier each task in high, medium or low or rank. You can use the Eisehower Matrix to categorise task importance.</p>

        <i class="fa-solid fa-clock"></i>
    <h3>Set a time to complete tasks</h3>
    <p>Setting a time limit will help you focus more on the task set such as deciding the importance of the task and whether you should dedicate more or less time in completion of the tasks. This could also be setting a timer, to which we have many developed on our main page for you to check out and use!</p>

    <h3>Look ahead</h3>
    <p>With a to-do-list, we guarantee this will make life much easier for you. By looking at tasks that will be coming up in the future, this will help you save a lot of time by preparing for upcoming projects saving you a lot of time and stress to ensure you don't feel overloaded but rather prepared. </p>
