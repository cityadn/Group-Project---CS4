    <h2 class="gold underline">How the 10-Minute rule works</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Select a task.</li>
      <li>Start working on it immediately.</li>
      <li>After ten minutes have passed, reflect
        on your focus and patience: do you want
        to stop working on the task, or do you
        wish to continue for 10 minutes more?</li>
        <li>Work for 10-minute time periods until
          you want to stop working on this task for
          the day.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="center-align">
    <h3 class="lime underline">Advantages of the 10-minute rule</h3>
    <li>Parsing your task into small time
      chunks will help you gain a sense of
      momentum because you're only obliged
      to work on it 10 minutes at a time.</li>
    <li>When you work only 10 minutes at a time,
      you don't feel overwhelmed, even with bigger
      tasks.</li>
    <li>Considering 10 minutes is a small amount
      of time, chances are you'll continue
      working for more 10-minute sets after
      the first one.</li>
    <li>Starting work immediately after you've
      selected the task means you'll have no time
      for negative thoughts and predictions.</li>

    <div class="center-align">
      <h3 class="red underline">Disadvantages of the 10-minute rule</h3>
      <li>Stopping every 10 minutes to consider whether
        you're up for another 10 minutes of work can
        get distracting, especially if you've immersed
        yourself in a task.</li>
