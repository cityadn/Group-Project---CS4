      <h1>Employment History</h1>
      <p>Previously I have small volunteering experience in places <br>
        such as Westfield handing out leaflets for small charitable <br> causes</p>

    <div class="interests">
      <h1>Hobbies & Interest</h1>
      <p>Aside from academics I was actively participating in karate from the
        age of 6 <br> but unfortunately stopped at 13 due to a lack of funding.
        I am an avid <br> swimmer and enjoy going swimming at my local leisure
        centre every <br> weekend with my siblings. Another one of my hobbies
        is playing football <br> as it has always been at the centre of my
        household and is universally a <br> phenomenon that brings people together.</p>

    <div class="skills">
      <h1>Skills and Abilities</h1>
      <p>At my secondary school I was selected to be a student prefect at
        the end of year 10 as I have proven to be a well-rounded student
        across all platforms including behaviour, commitment and my
        attainments. I initially applied for the role in order to
        gain experience in working alongside my peers through the
        duties that are assigned to me weekly. Through this position I
        have been able to gain organisational skills from maintaining
        the cleanliness of the books in the library to watching over
        younger students in the success lounge and assisting them with
        any work they have. I landed this role due to my unwavering
        good attendance, good presentation of my school uniform and
        respectable behaviour. All these qualities are necessary as
        I view prefects as school ambassadors and believe these attributes
        should be maintained through to college, university and eventually
        in the workplace.</p>
