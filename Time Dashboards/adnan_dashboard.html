                After lecture days I do 2 to 3 hours of revision.
                Revision here includes Python, Mathematics and/or
                Web Development revision. On non-lecture days I spend 4 to 6 hours
                doing revision, as well as practice on Python and Java coding.
                I love doing challenges based on both programming languages as it
                drives me to develop my skill of criticial thinking, a skill is
                a must have in the IT industry. This practice not only develops
                my skills and thinking, but gives me a sense of accomplishment
                for the day.

                I, am a Lego Enthusiast, if you will. I collect a lot of
                Lego (on a budget, because I'm poor). My favourite lego theme
                is Ninjago, as it's a childhood show that has a special
                place in my heart. It has stuck with me for years and
                the tv show has taught me a lot of life lessons, despite being
                a 'kids' show. My favourite Ninja is Zane, and my favourite
                quote from him is "I am built to protect those, who cannot
                protect themselves". He is someone/a nindroid (robot) that
                I aspire to be.

                When I get a chance to call my best friends, I tend to talk
                about Marvel a lot. Some of them say I overdo it, which is NOT
                true... I think. I have a circle of 4 friends that I call and
                talk to regularly, and 5 others who I hang out with. My favourite
                superhero is Spider-Man. Back in 2018 I was going through a tough
                time where I was at one of my lowest points. I then watched Avengers:
                Infinity War, where my obsession with Spider-Man had sparked.
                I then played the PS4 Spider-Man game, which solidified Spider-Man
                as the greatest superhero in comic book history by giving me an
                emotional, impeccable story and set of characters. An optimistic
                resilient character, who never gives up hope even when he loses
                everything. I aspire to have that mindset.

                I have a great interest in Boxing. From Monday to Friday
                I visit the BoxUp Gym for 2 hrs each day, from 7:30am to 9:30am.
                My favourite move in Boxing is the left hook. A boring/simple
                technique (yes, I know, relax), but an underrated one. It is
                effective in combat. A left hook can dehabillitate your opponent
                by cutting off their breathing. With repeated shots you can
                decrease their stamina. A well placed one shot (most likely to
                the liver) may knock an opponent out. As for other excercise activities,
                my two main excercises include Push-Ups and Forearm Curls, which
                I do at home. For now I can do 20 Push-Ups regularly in 1 set. The
                maximum I have ever done is 45. I am now trying to get to 50 reps
                in one set.
